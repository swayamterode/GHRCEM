# G H RAISONI COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING & MANAGEMENT, WAGHOLI, PUNE

## This repository is mainly for the GHRCEM Students

As I am currently in SEM 2 (2021). So this repository contains all the files that you require for the submissions of assignments as well as Practical submissions.
It also contains all the question papers of **CAE** & **ESE**.

I will update the repository regularly whenever I will get some updates from the college regarding the **Assignments, Notes, and practical Submissions**.
