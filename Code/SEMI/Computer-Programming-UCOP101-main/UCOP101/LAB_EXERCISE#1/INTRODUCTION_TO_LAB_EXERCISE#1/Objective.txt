LAB EXERCISE #1

Objective(s):
To be familiar with syntax and structure of C- programming. 
To learn problem solving techniques using C

Program: 
Write a Program to calculate and display the volume of a CUBE having its height (h=10cm), 
width (w=12cm) and depth (8cm).

Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Define variables: h(int), w(int), d(int), vol(int)
3. Assign value to variables: h = 10, w=12, d=8
4. Calculate the volume as: vol = h*w*d
5. Display the volume (vol)
6. Stop
